This project was created as a convenience for assuring the quality of migrated data. It provides schema and data comparison (as of 07/26/2017 in varying degrees of completeness). A future goal is to allow for updating one database with the schema or data of another more quickly than having to do an entire database dump and restore and with minimal setup.
