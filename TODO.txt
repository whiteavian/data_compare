This is a (very) rough to-do list for this project. It will (hopefully) become more readable, more complete, and better organized soon.

TODO:
- docstrings in sql_database
- how should we store errors?
- once we've done that, how should we present them?
- sort data asc by pk

- In what format should we collect the data discrepancies? These are currently stored in self.errors, but we should probably avoid using the term errors, which has specific connations in programming.
- How should we record errors in the matching_row method, which is run on the comparand during compare.
- Once we have collected our discrepancies, how should we present them?
- Can we turn our discrepancies into formats that will allow for updating the comparand to match the original?

Relational Data
# Eventual TODO: account for different data types
# Ex: utf8 vs latin1
# Boolean 0 == False, etc
# Eventual TODO: suggest rows are the same based on similarity of contents.
# Is there any reason why we would actually want that?
